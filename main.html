	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing how its runtime grows with input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexities like 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) or 
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(logn), ensuring faster execution and optimal performance. This concept is crucial for designing scalable and effective solutions.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the memory required by an algorithm, with efficient solutions often achieving O(n) O(n) O(n) or better for optimal resource use.</p>
